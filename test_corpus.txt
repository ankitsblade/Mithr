The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it.
It formed 4.6 billion years from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud.
The vast majority (99.86%) of the system's mass is in the Sun, with most of the remaining mass
contained in the planet Jupiter. The four inner terrestrial planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.
They are composed primarily of rock and metal. The four outer giant planets are Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus, and Neptune. They are substantially more massive than the terrestrials. Jupiter and Saturn
are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets,
Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of substances with relatively high
melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as water, ammonia, and methane.
All eight planets have nearly circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.
