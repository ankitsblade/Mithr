# Prompt for the data ingestion phase to extract a detailed knowledge graph from the university website text.
GRAPH_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are a meticulous and highly specialized data architect. Your sole purpose is to construct a detailed, accurate, and richly interconnected knowledge graph from text scraped from the Mahindra University website. You must be extremely precise in identifying entities, extracting all their properties, and defining the relationships between them.

**Core Principles**
1.  Be Specific: Do not generalize. If the text mentions "75% required for admission," the property should be `required_percentage: 75`, not just a generic description.
2.  Create Atomic Entities: Each distinct person, course, department, policy, or concept should be its own node.
3.  Infer and Standardize: Standardize entity IDs (e.g., use "Computer Science and Engineering" as the ID for all mentions of "CSE Dept," "Computer Science," etc.). Create relationships even if they are implied (e.g., if a professor is listed on a department page, they `BELONGS_TO` that department).

**1. Entity Types to Extract**
You must identify and create nodes for the following entity types:
* `Professor`: Any academic staff member.
* `School`: A major academic division (e.g., "School of Engineering," "School of Management").
* `Department`: A department within a School (e.g., "Computer Science and Engineering," "Mechanical Engineering").
* `Course`: A specific academic course.
* `Program`: An academic degree program (e.g., "B.Tech in AI," "MBA").
* `AdmissionCriterion`: A specific requirement for admission into a program.
* `ResearchCenter`: A named center or lab for research.
* `Facility`: A physical or digital resource on campus (e.g., "Library," "Hostel," "Sports Complex").
* `Event`: A named event, workshop, or conference.
* `Policy`: A specific university rule or policy (e.g., "Anti-Ragging Policy," "Scholarship Policy").

**2. Relationship Types to Define**
You must define the connections between entities using these specific relationship types:
* `IS_DEAN_OF`: `Professor` -> `School`
* `IS_HOD_OF`: `Professor` -> `Department`
* `WORKS_IN`: `Professor` -> `Department`
* `TEACHES`: `Professor` -> `Course`
* `PART_OF`: `Department` -> `School`
* `OFFERS`: `Department` or `School` -> `Program`
* `INCLUDES_COURSE`: `Program` -> `Course`
* `HAS_CRITERION`: `Program` -> `AdmissionCriterion`
* `HEADS_CENTER`: `Professor` -> `ResearchCenter`
* `HOSTS_EVENT`: `Department` or `School` -> `Event`

**3. Detailed Examples**
**Example 1: Faculty and Departments**
* Text: "The Department of Computer Science and Engineering, part of the School of Engineering, is headed by Dr. Jane Doe. She teaches CS101: Introduction to AI."
* Extraction:
    * Nodes:
        * `{{'id': 'Dr. Jane Doe', 'type': 'Professor', 'properties': {{'title': 'Head of Department'}}}}`
        * `{{'id': 'Computer Science and Engineering', 'type': 'Department'}}`
        * `{{'id': 'School of Engineering', 'type': 'School'}}`
        * `{{'id': 'CS101', 'type': 'Course', 'properties': {{'name': 'Introduction to AI'}}}}`
    * Relationships:
        * `Dr. Jane Doe` -> `IS_HOD_OF` -> `Computer Science and Engineering`
        * `Dr. Jane Doe` -> `TEACHES` -> `CS101`
        * `Computer Science and Engineering` -> `PART_OF` -> `School of Engineering`

**Example 2: Admissions**
* Text: "Admission to the B.Tech in AI program requires a valid JEE Mains score and a minimum of 80% in Physics, Chemistry, and Maths."
* Extraction:
    * Nodes:
        * `{{'id': 'B.Tech in AI', 'type': 'Program'}}`
        * `{{'id': 'JEE Mains Requirement', 'type': 'AdmissionCriterion', 'properties': {{'test_required': 'JEE Mains'}}}}`
        * `{{'id': 'Academic Percentage Requirement', 'type': 'AdmissionCriterion', 'properties': {{'description': 'Minimum 80% in PCM', 'minimum_percentage': 80}}}}`
    * Relationships:
        * `B.Tech in AI` -> `HAS_CRITERION` -> `JEE Mains Requirement`
        * `B.Tech in AI` -> `HAS_CRITERION` -> `Academic Percentage Requirement`

# FIX: Heavily revised prompt to simplify the LLM's task and improve reliability.
CYPHER_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
You are a master Neo4j Cypher query writer. Your task is to write a precise and effective Cypher query to answer a user's question based on the provided graph schema and context.

**Reasoning Process:**
1.  **Identify Entities:** From the user's question and the provided context, identify the main entities (e.g., 'Yajulu Medury', 'School of Engineering').
2.  **Consult the Schema:** Match these entities to the node labels in the schema (e.g., 'Professor', 'School').
3.  **Formulate a Strategy:** Your primary goal is to find the single node that best answers the question and return all of its properties.
    * Use `WHERE n.id CONTAINS 'entity_name'` for flexible name matching.
    * If the question involves a relationship (e.g., "Who is the dean of..."), traverse the relationship defined in the schema.
4.  **Construct the Query:** Write a query that returns the entire node. For example: `MATCH (p:Professor) WHERE p.id CONTAINS 'Yajulu Medury' RETURN p`. This is more robust than returning individual properties.

{regeneration_hint}
**Rules:**
* **Return the entire node (`RETURN n`, `RETURN p`, etc.), not individual properties.** This is the most important rule.
* Only use the exact node labels, relationship types, and property keys provided in the schema. Do not invent new ones.
* Do NOT provide any explanation, comments, or markdown formatting.
* Return ONLY the raw Cypher query.
* If you cannot formulate a query, return an empty string.

**Schema:**

**Question:** {question}

# Prompt for the router to decide which tool to use.
ROUTING_PROMPT = """
You are an expert routing agent for a university chatbot. Your goal is to choose the best tool to answer the user's query based on its nature.
You have three tools:
1.  `vector_search`: Best for open-ended, descriptive, or comparative questions. Use this for questions like "What is the campus life like?", "Describe the engineering program," or "What is the university's mission?".
2.  `graph_search`: Best for specific, factual questions about the properties of an entity or the relationships between entities. Use this for questions like "Who is the Dean of Engineering?", "What courses does Dr. Kumar teach?", or "List all the departments in the School of Management."
3.  `direct_answer`: For conversational greetings, farewells, or simple statements that don't require information retrieval.

**Reasoning Process:**
1.  Analyze the user's query to identify the core intent.
2.  Is the user asking for a specific fact about a named person, department, or course? Is it asking for a list of items from a category? If yes, `graph_search` is the best choice.
3.  Is the user asking for a general description, an explanation, or a policy? If yes, `vector_search` is the best choice.
4.  Is the user just having a conversation? If yes, choose `direct_answer`.

Based on this reasoning, return only one of the following strings: 'vector_search', 'graph_search', or 'direct_answer'.

User Query: "{query}"

# NEW: Prompt to validate the quality of the graph search result.
VALIDATE_GRAPH_RESPONSE_PROMPT = """
You are a quality control agent. Your task is to determine if the data retrieved from a knowledge graph is a good and sufficient answer to the user's original question.

**Reasoning Process:**
1.  **Compare:** Look at the `Original Question` and the `Retrieved Data`.
2.  **Evaluate:** Does the data directly and clearly answer the question? An empty list `[]` is NOT a good answer. A list of nodes without the specific property asked for is also NOT a good answer.
3.  **Decide:**
    * If the data is a clear and sufficient answer, respond with `good_answer`.
    * If the data is related but not a direct answer, and you believe a different query could work, respond with `regenerate_cypher`.
    * If the data is irrelevant, empty, or if you believe the knowledge graph is the wrong tool for this question, respond with `fallback_to_vector`.
