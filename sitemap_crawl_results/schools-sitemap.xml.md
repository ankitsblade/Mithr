**Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world – Nelson Mandela**
In a short journey of two and a half years, Mahindra University has marked its presence in the Indian higher education landscape and is emerging as a leading center of multi-disciplinary ideas, research and teaching, preparing future thinkers and leaders for a world that is ever changing, and yet promising. Indira Mahindra School of Education draws spirit and inspiration from the overall vision of the university and positions itself as an instrument for developing global thinkers and leaders in educational research, policy, planning, practice and management. It aims to emerge as a centre of excellence in Educational Studies by providing good quality teaching, research, consulting and training facilities to students, researchers, academics, governmental and non-governmental organisations, national and international institutions and other practitioners of education.
Education as a discipline draws hugely from other social sciences and humanities, so it is inevitable that Indira Mahindra School of Education too incorporates other social sciences and humanities alongside core fields of Education in its teaching and research agendas so that it flourishes as a centre for advancement and production of knowledge. The location of Indira Mahindra School of Education within an ambience of synergetic, mutually interacting, multi- disciplinary Schools allows it to usher in as an incubator of new ideas and collaborations. The School seeks to further these goals by inventing new academic programmes which are in sync and, at times, at the frontiers of the overall trends in the country and abroad.
The School has already begun bringing in a pool of very talented and reputed faculty from all over the country, who have made their names in their respective fields of expertise within Educational Studies and who have been trained and taught in well- known and highly ranked institutions nationally and internationally. With their active involvement, the School seeks to build partnerships between itself and the development sector, educational initiatives of the corporates and the government, schools, universities and other institutions, to feed each other with mutually beneficial and field advancing ideas and learnings.
Indira Mahindra School of Education has already launched its Doctoral program, and will be launching its M.A in Education in the academic year 2023-24 and Bachelor degree program in the year 2024-25. The School will be a place to be in if you wish to fly high in the arena of ‘Education’ in India and in South Asia. Hope you come and join us in this mission of creating a world class center of excellence for Educational Studies!

# École Centrale School of Engineering
Overview
[Courses Offered](https://mahindrauniversity.edu.in/schools/ecole-centrale-school-of-engineering/courses-offered/)
![Rise Of The New Engineer](https://mahindrauniversity.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Group-128-1.webp)
With the core intent of establishing one of the best engineering colleges in India and beyond, Mahindra University École Centrale School of Engineering (MU) was born out of a collaboration between two giants:  
Mahindra Group – a leader of the industrial sector in India, and École Centrale Paris – a 180-year-old institute of eminence, instrumental in the progress of technology.
While Mahindra Group is a multinational organisation worth USD 17.8 billion, and 2,00,000 employees across 100 countries, whose businesses are driven primarily by engineering and technology; École Centrale Paris has been the alma mater to prestigious alumni whose contributions to the world have been pivotal: Gustave Eiffel, and founders of many renowned international organisations like Renault, Peugeot, Dior, Michelin, etc.
Having evolved from such illustrious parentage, MU aims to reach the pinnacle of excellence in engineering education by offering industry-aligned undergraduate B.Tech courses that are globally relevant. With the establishment of Mahindra University, Mahindra École Centrale College of Engineering has been subsumed under the university.
While the college earlier offered 4 Engineering programs (CSE, EEE, Civil, and Mechanical), Mahindra University, housed at the same location, has expanded significantly. It now comprises 7 schools: École Centrale School of Engineering, School of Management, School of Law, Indira Mahindra School of Education, School of Media & School of Design Innovation and recently launched School of Hospitality Management, while offering about 50 UG, PG & Ph.D. programs across different schools.

###### Dean of École Centrale School of Engineering
A very warm welcome to Mahindra Ecole Centrale School of Engineering (ECSoE). You may be wondering why our name sounds so French! Indeed, we have a vital partnership with the Groupe [des Écoles Centrale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrale_Graduate_School) which, in English, translates to ‘Central Schools Group’. This group, which is globally renowned for excellence in Engineering education, embraces five Institutions in France and three international schools including ECSoE under its umbrella.
Our graduating students, having gone through our rigorous, interdisciplinary research-centric programs that are at-par with international standards at top schools around the world, are expected to be Global Thinkers and Engaged Leaders – in perfect sync with the Rise Philosophy of the Mahindra Group of industries.

Our graduating students, having gone through our rigorous, interdisciplinary research-centric programs that are at-par with international standards at top schools around the world, are expected to be Global Thinkers and Engaged Leaders – in perfect sync with the Rise Philosophy of the Mahindra Group of industries.
We started in mid-2014 as the Mahindra Ecole Centrale college of engineering affiliated to Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad and, since 2020, are now part of the autonomous Mahindra University (MU) in Hyderabad (Telangana, India). Our elite faculty members come with impressive credentials as researchers and are passionate about making MU a reputed research university with strong support from our management for pursuing interdisciplinary initiatives.
We believe that the teaching-learning process in education is most effective and engaging when complemented with unique research experiences of our educators who augment their classroom lectures with cutting-edge applications and emerging technologies in their respective domains. In addition to our core engineering subjects, we also offer carefully curated courses in the liberal arts and firmly believe that this unique symphony between the two contributes immensely towards grooming well-rounded engineers and technologists of the future.
Our Board of Studies comprises an impressive cohort of External Experts from reputed institutions such as the IITs, IISc as also industry leaders. We also encourage our students to develop an entrepreneurial spirit by offering relevant training for developing business models and honing their leadership skills. In fact, words such as ‘interdisciplinary’, ‘innovation’, ‘entrepreneurial mindset’ are heard often on campus! Those motivated to pursue higher education and research careers can access a diverse basket of elective courses in their 3rd and 4th years of study. On an average, over 40% of our students’ secure admission to higher education programs in globally reputed universities in USA and Europe. We are now gradually introducing more and more new, interdisciplinary M.Tech programs, in addition to our existing Ph.D. programs that are at par with similar programs in tier-1 institutions globally. I urge you to visit our website for information and exciting updates about Mahindra University.
We eagerly look forward to hearing from you!

It aims to prepare our graduates as righteous, responsible, competent and globally acceptable citizens of the world. It is the outcome of perceived need at the intersection of the fields and practices of mediated communication, communication technology and social change.
With a focus on creativity and innovation in the digital age and beyond. Our School of Digital Media and Communication provides a platform for aspiring media professionals to understand the role of communication in our lives. In doing so, they develop competencies in three directions—the conceptual, the practical/professional/technical, and the ethical. Our programs offer a set of courses that refreshes different in approach. Starting with an understanding of how we learn as humans, students learn how media psychology works. As a new school, we recognize the deep and wide gaps in the supply of professional graduates in today’s media and technology industries. One of the widest and deepest such gaps is in understanding how humans think, feel and work. This is one of the components of study that will make our graduates a cut above the rest.
The school provides state-of-the-art facilities including a spacious audiovisual studio floor with a production control room (PCR), an audio studio, a MoJo studio (with cyclorama), an immersive (VR-XR) studio floor, and a fully equipped editing and computing laboratory with uncompromising features. We use industry standard equipment after carefully researching and examining those standards, while also augmenting our facilities for future use. Thus, our students learn in the best possible environment while gaining various professional and technical competencies as they learn media and related practices.
Come, discover what you can do, and be surprised!
  * ###### [Purpose](https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/schools/school-of-media/#tab-c1c2424e0208a0f8e2e)


Hence, the purpose of the School is to equip students with the analytical tools to confront the world of communication, in the following ways:
  * To provide an edge to our graduates through their competencies.
  * To nurture learners through real-world practices, to improve upon them, and to build an ethically sound ecosystem.
  * To use a technology-equipped and humanities-centric approach.


Our School of Digital Media and Communication was born in the academic year 2023-24 with two bachelor’s programmes. We offer a 3-year Bachelor of Journalism and Mass Communication and a 4-year Bachelor of Journalism and Mass Communication (Hons.), and a 4-year B.Tech in Computation and Media. With the application of digital technology, the media and related industries have been experiencing unprecedented growth. The introduction of mediated communication for the public at large has meant that this growth has become a mass movement among “media prosumers”—consumers who are also producers of media texts. Since everyone equipped with a smartphone is a potential media prosumer, the practice of superior mediated communication defines its contours. This is not merely a technological change but a sociological one. To that end, our Bachelor of Journalism and Mass Communication and B.Tech. programmes recognize digital technology as an inevitable and integral part of mediated communication today and in time to come.
This exciting time also presents several challenges. The ever-evolving field of mass communication now, more than ever before, needs an all-round understanding of technology and sociology, between message and its construction. This convergence of information, entertainment, opinion, promotion and distribution presents an exciting new cornucopia of activities bundled together.
There is also convergence in another way. In addition to a steady demand for professionals in the more conventional roles in news, entertainment, and the allied areas of advertising and public relations, there is an increasing demand for digital journalists, content creators and digital marketing professionals. Legacy media platforms are investing heavily on the digital side of their businesses. Other industries, too, are investing in creating or recasting media rooms in digitized forms, from which internal and external communication and corporate storytelling occurs. The ability to understand, delineate and control each of these activities distinguishes the media and communication professional from a prosumer.
To that end, our programmes integrate all that is needed in this new and evolving ecosystem to deliver academically sound, research-oriented, practically trained graduates. You will gain exposure to cutting-edge developments, both in technology and techniques of creating content and its delivery for the functions of news, entertainment, PR, advertising, corporate communication, and digital platforms.
In 2024, we have added a Ph.D. programme in Media and Communication. Master’s programmes in journalism, mass communication, and communication management will be introduced in 2025.
Enabling the practical side of learning are our three digital studios:
  1. A large floor with two sets including a production control room (PCR), a greenscreen set, a conventional set, and a conveniently styled gallery-seating space;
  2. An audio studio; and

  * To nurture _improved practices_ of mediated communication with an aim towards better societies capable of balancing the use of communication in responsible ways.
  * To approach learning as a _methodology_ to develop future thought.
  * To prepare students to be changemakers using _competencies_.


  * ###### [Learning process](https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/schools/school-of-media/#tab-32d57a54dde6e43e8a3)


At the School of Digital Media and Communication, it is our endeavour to see learning as a joint venture between the student and the institution. How a student peels an onion ring, going deeper into the funnel of learning, must be demonstrated by linking concepts to practice. Using this process, our courses are designed around student-centric learning processes and competency outcomes of three dimensions—conceptual, practical/professional, and ethical.
Through the period of a student’s journey, we will introduce a variety of learning mechanisms and tools, including classes, laboratory work, independent and field work, library, guest interactions, and self-discovery. However, the student will quickly recognize the complexities in the practice and learn to problematize practices while developing an increasingly firm grip on fundamental concepts of the functions of journalism, media production and communication management. It is this blend that makes our graduates technologically strong and ethically sound, conceptually clear and practically adept.
Exposing students to eclectic voices is an important part of their learning. Academic, institutional, and industry partnerships include reputed institutions and organizations from around the world. The student’s journey will be peppered with guest visits and demonstrations, field visits and internships. We expect the student to have fun while being serious-minded, relish hard work while not losing out on the enjoyment of life’s normal experiences.
The curriculum has been prepared with the student’s journey in focus. How does a student navigate the path to the world of practice? That is the fundamental pedagogic question we seek to answer; we believe the answer lies in taking the student through increasingly complex units of knowledge. Hence, amidst the cornucopia of coursework lie clearly focused pipelines for each strand. Faculty members are empowered at the School of Digital Media and Communication to bring their philosophies, perspectives, and content. Our institution welcomes and encourages the use of individual strengths and thought. Students will receive specific syllabi with textbooks (if any) and indications of reading material at the beginning of each course.
  * ###### [Methodology](https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/schools/school-of-media/#tab-6996759e21eee900146)


We will employ the highest standards to develop and nurture qualities needed for a student to be a changemaker. The input is carefully constructed keeping in mind the demands of industries and businesses, as well as the needs of our societies, to generate a conceptually, ethically, practically and behaviourally consummate graduate who is aware of the rights, responsibilities and privileges of an educated and communicative citizen. Special emphasis will be laid on digital and emerging media technologies as we further update the institution on the basis of technological and sociological developments.  
Programme goals. The objectives of our programmes are heavily centred around the learner.
  * Competency-building. To build the competencies through academic delivery that aims to develop sophistication of thought, value of ethics, and practice of rigour.
  * Matching individual with society and industry. To have a student-centred approach that nurtures individuality by matching aptitudes and aspirations against scope and needs of media society and related industry.
  * Building communicative societies. To approach learning as grounded yet dynamic sets of guidelines towards the achievement of communicative goals of society and industry.
  * Interdisciplinarity. To relate and integrate the study of media with other disciplines especially in humanities and social sciences.
  * Onion-peel. To adopt a general-to-specific approach to learning.


Thus, competency-building is the fulcrum of the collaborative interface between the School of Digital Media and Communication and the student. The various demonstrable elements of these competencies perform a critical role not only for a student in the commitment to their role and exercise of responsible agency, but also for the institution in its commitment to the student. To us, competency is not to be defined in narrow curricular or practical success terms, but as the development of a personality that is professionally, critically, and ethically superior—thinking problem-solving researchers and professionals who can rethink paradigms and not become cookie-cutter bench-warmers.
The tripod of competencies. As a derivation from the above philosophical grounding, each of our programmes emerge as a marker, a demonstration of the following competencies—in combination—that will define and test this pursuit:
  * Conceptual competency: The academic grounding of thought in various subjects and fields upon which practice is founded.
  * Professional competency: A preliminary familiarity in simulated and live environments with practices among communication industries and communicative institutions.
  * Ethical competency: The development of a moral compass and an awareness of the need for a set of guiding principles for various forms of practices in industries and societies.


Furthermore, competency is a changemaking methodology, which goes well beyond the development of skills alone. It is the ability to adapt with a combination of acquired strengths and learnt behaviour. That is why we are convinced that the building of skills must necessarily accompany the construction of other attitudes that both enable and moderate our practices. The tripodic combination of competencies as described above is also individual. To that end, we believe it is imperative to keep our objectives student-centric and nurture individuals-in-societies—that is, individuals who are grounded in the governance of various industrial and sociocultural communities.  
Our approach is multi-pronged in the sense that the student must be prepared both in and out of classrooms. Some forms this would take would bridge traditionally disparate paradigms:
  * Professional and academically grounded programmes (neither a “trade school” nor a typical university programme, but a good combination of the two).
  * Interdisciplinary with high emphasis on research.
  * Project- and evidence-based progression in learning, creating and documenting tangible footprints of learning as the student progresses.


_Two approaches_ that can sustain the University head and shoulders above the normal fare we observe around us. There are several methodological ‘firsts’ that the University would have. A broader philosophy of approaching academics as a _student-centric endeavour_ rather than just a set of tasks for us to accomplish will go a long way in establishing the University as a pioneer in disruptive methods in higher education. This by corollary entails a student-centric vision, mission, plan, and pedagogy. How do we help a student achieve his/her professional objectives?
The approaches I have explained below are needed for the much-talked-about (yet elusive!) excellence in higher education per se. In communication, I believe they are both critical, but I suspect their relevance can easily be mapped onto other fields. As you may observe from these approaches, the pedagogy, or the “ _how_ ”, has precedence over the content, or the “ _what_ ” of higher education.
First, we ask ourselves what the end objective of a student’s tenure with us is. We may assume it is gainful employment, either in the industry or self-employment, through a combination of conceptual and field exposure, theory-application and practical output.
Second, we identify what approaches we must adopt to fulfil that objective. In short, our endeavour must be to adopt methodological approaches that facilitate a student to transform into a responsible professional with a researcher’s mind.
  * ###### [Industry, global outreach](https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/schools/school-of-media/#tab-1a606c02b5a648570e2)


  * _One_ social sector internship or initiative for 1-2 months is mandated for each programme. This internship precedes most other field activities because of our belief that learning about the society in all its diversity is an utmost need for any professional or researcher, especially in a country where the model and economics of private higher education favour the privileged class. However, this ecosystem can help by offering the student the experience that privilege often denies—the exposure to the “other side of society”. It is our hope that this experience turns out to be transformational for a potential changemaker.
  * _Two_ specialized industry internships for 2-3 months each at advanced stages of the programme. A placement cell will make efforts to place students in these internships. We are well geared up to address student-specific internships. The industries and functions are listed here; however, this is a list that can change and expand over time: 
    * Newspaper newsrooms and production units
    * Digital newsrooms and production units
    * Television newsrooms and production units
    * Television show production houses
    * Digital production and digital marketing agencies
    * Digital film production housesMedia and film marketing agencies
    * Advertising agencies
    * Public relations consultancies
    * Corporate communication divisions
    * Event management
    * Digital agencies
    * Game design studios
    * Editing and FX studios
  * One optional post-course internship in the student’s choice of specialized industry or sector.
  * In lieu of the final internship, a media entrepreneurship project may be incubated and implemented. An entrepreneurship course in media- or communication-related domains is offered in lieu of any one of the internships. Under this, innovative projects will be incubated and presented to industry experts and to potential investors. Students may opt for domains that may be different from their core specialization.


  * ###### [Global connect](https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/schools/school-of-media/#tab-31aa7bd7228f9b45387)

###### Dean of School of Media
We began by asking ourselves what the big need in our society is, how our industries are fulfilling those social needs, and how our students should be prepared to understand and contribute to both the social needs and the professional practices. To that end, our programmes take a digital-first approach, embracing new and emerging technology. However, they are firmly grounded—students invariably learn the genesis, history and current practices that are foundational to our fields. Despite our belief in such foundational grounding, we remain nimble-footed in our perception of the needs that we encounter.  
The reason, of course, is that many of these needs arise externally offering both opportunities and challenges. Emerging technology is an example. Two approaches are envisioned for this school—technology-equipped and humanities-centric. Our School makes every effort to provide the right edge to our graduates, preparing them for real-world practices and to improve upon those practices using such humanistic tools as ethics and creativity. We consider such an amalgamation of technology and humanism the need of the hour, a need that technocrats, entrepreneurs and governments are also increasingly aware of.  
Another dimension of our School’s academic approach is the diversity in the courses and in the strands of specialization. Using a funnel-like approach and going from general to specific and from simple to complex, we offer learnings to the student that go beyond the core. Courses like Learning to Learn; The Indian Constitution; Drawing, and many more are intended to expand the mind and the horizons of understanding the world. This understanding is at the heart of the best practices of journalism, filmmaking, advertising, public relations, marketing, and other related professions that our graduates will enter.  
We offer a lively, open and interactive environment both in and out of classes. Students may find the faculty and staff approachable and friendly, always ready to listen, encourage, resolve, and provide direction. In that sense, we are all mentors eager to help address specific needs. Our classroom methods are dynamic and involve both fun and serious-minded activities. This combination speaks to the philosophy that while learning can be fun, it should never waver from the final objective of preparing the student in the best possible ways to enter and bring positive change in the societies.  
Finally, a student will find that the School is committed to global standards. This means, fundamentally, that a student of our School should be competent enough to straddle the world—perhaps a student might seek to pursue further studies abroad, or may encounter work of an international scale in their profession. We find it both practical and important to prepare our student in conceptual, professional and ethical ways to a global environment.  
We would be happy to answer questions. Do get in touch!
With best regards,  
Shashidhar Nanjundaiah

## About Us
Mahindra University’s School of Media aims to prepare our graduates as righteous, responsible, competent and globally acceptable citizens of the world. The School of Media is the outcome of a perceived need at the intersection of the fields and practices of mediated communication, communication technology and social change.
## Purpose
Hence, the purpose of the School is to equip students with the analytical tools to confront the world of communication, in the following ways:
  * To provide an edge to our graduates through their competencies.
  * To nurture learners through real-world practices, to improve upon them, and to build an ethically sound ecosystem.
  * To use a technology-equipped and humanities-centric approach.


Our School of Media was born in the academic year 2023-24 with two bachelor’s programmes. We offer a 3-year BA and a 4-year BA (Hons.) in Journalism and Mass Communication, and a 4-year BTech in Computation and Media. With the application of digital technology, the media and related industries have been experiencing unprecedented growth. The introduction of mediated communication for the public at large has meant that this growth has become a mass movement among “media prosumers”—consumers who are also producers of media texts. Since everyone equipped with a smartphone is a potential media prosumer, the practice of superior mediated communication defines its contours. This is not merely a technological change but a sociological one. To that end, our BA and BTech. programmes recognize digital technology as an inevitable and integral part of mediated communication today and in time to come.
This exciting time also presents several challenges. The ever-evolving field of mass communication now, more than ever before, needs an all-round understanding of technology and sociology, between message and its construction. This convergence of information, entertainment, opinion, promotion and distribution presents an exciting new cornucopia of activities bundled together.
There is also convergence in another way. In addition to a steady demand for professionals in the more conventional roles in news, entertainment, and the allied areas of advertising and public relations, there is an increasing demand for digital journalists, content creators and digital marketing professionals. Legacy media platforms are investing heavily on the digital side of their businesses. Other industries, too, are investing in creating or recasting media rooms in digitized forms, from which internal and external communication and corporate storytelling occurs. The ability to understand, delineate and control each of these activities distinguishes the media and communication professional from a prosumer.
To that end, our programmes integrate all that is needed in this new and evolving ecosystem to deliver academically sound, research-oriented, practically trained graduates. You will gain exposure to cutting-edge developments, both in technology and techniques of creating content and its delivery for the functions of news, entertainment, PR, advertising, corporate communication, and digital platforms.
In 2024, we have added a Ph.D. programme in Media and Communication. Master’s programmes in journalism, mass communication, and communication management will be introduced in 2025.
Enabling the practical side of learning are our three digital studios: (i) a large floor with two sets including a production control room (PCR), a greenscreen set, a conventional set, and a conveniently styled gallery-seating space; (ii) an audio studio; and (iii) an immersive media studio floor with cyclorama and other paraphernalia for such exciting productions as music videos.
## Vision and mission
  * To nurture _improved practices_ of mediated communication with an aim towards better societies capable of balancing the use of communication in responsible ways.
  * To approach _learning as a methodology_ to develop future thought.
  * To prepare students to be changemakers using _competencies_.

## **Finance Research Lab**
The Finance Research Lab at the School of Management, Mahindra University is a state-of-the-art facility designed to support cutting-edge research in finance. Our facilities are designed to support innovative and collaborative research in finance and to provide our researchers with the resources they need to advance the field. The Bloomberg terminal and NSE simulation software are two important tools available in the Finance Research Lab that help support research and analysis of financial markets and investments.
The Bloomberg terminal is a sophisticated financial data and news platform that provides users with real-time information and analysis on financial markets, investments, and economic news. It includes a wide range of features, such as news feeds, analytics, financial data, and trading tools, which are invaluable for researchers analysing financial markets and conducting investment research. The terminal also includes powerful analytical tools, such as charting and technical analysis, which can help researchers identify trends and patterns in financial data. Researchers can also use Bloomberg to perform financial modelling and to test investment strategies.
The NSE simulation software is a virtual trading platform that is designed to simulate a real trading environment in the National Stock Exchange (NSE), providing users with access to real-time market data, news feeds, and trading tools. Users can create and manage a virtual portfolio, execute trades, and monitor their performance in real-time. This software provides a hands-on experience for researchers and students to practice trading strategies and test their investment hypotheses in a simulated environment before investing real money. It provides a risk-free environment to experiment with different trading strategies and to learn from successes and failures.
Together, these tools are critical to supporting research and analysis of financial markets, investment strategies, and economic trends. The Finance Research Lab provides access to these tools to ensure that our researchers and students have the necessary resources to conduct innovative research and make informed investment decisions.

  * ###### [Mission and Vision](https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/schools/school-of-design-innovation/#tab-8a201b347fb8efb42b0)


**Mission:**
The School of Design Innovation at Mahindra University is dedicated to nurturing designers to create impactful, human-centred solutions keeping in mind the local cultural practices and systems. The School’s focus is to encourage entrepreneurship and support govt. and NGOs to promote sustainable livelihoods. The School’s mission is to drive innovation that works for people, deliver real-world benefits, and inspires future-ready designers.
Through talented and motivated faculty and international collaborations SDI strives to bring in the required talents in the students through live projects. The School’s collaboration with incubators and its adaptative curriculum enables it to introduce startup culture early in the students’ learning. The school’s endeavour is to create innovative leaders who will shape industries, communities, and economies for a better world.
**Vision:**  
Innovation can change the world in ways that are unimaginable. Yet there are some who can visualize such a change and develop product and services that are readily adopted by the people and transform the way they live and dream. Soon such innovations become the strong backbone of the society, industry, and the economy.
The School of Design Innovation at Mahindra University envisions a world where designers drive meaningful change. They solve real-world problems and create transformative solutions. SDI aims to nurture designers who not only understand people but also develop impactful products and services that address societal and industrial challenges.

  * ###### [Idea to Impact ](https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/schools/school-of-design-innovation/#tab-9d178a7c4a15141dae8)


The School of Design Innovation will be mentored by the best design brains from across the world. This pursuit of design excellence is bolstered by a partnership with the Pininfarina Design Academy in Torino, Italy and Shenoy Innovation Studio IDC IITB.
The labs and studios across Mahindra University are well equipped so that students can build their mock-ups and proof of concepts for design innovation. The students are motivated to use the Chakku’s 7 concerns of design thinking, formulated by our founding dean Prof. B.K. Chakravarthy from his 3 decades of design innovation experience. This is used as a project management template and collaborative tool for taking design to market.
**Design Differentiator:**
**_SDI design methodology follows the Innovation by Design paradigm, where design thinking exists in a continuous, reciprocal loop like a Möbius strip- ensuring that the process and the outcomes are seamlessly interconnected and continuously refined._**
Mahindra University promotes teamwork among students from various fields to tackle real-world challenges. The humanities help in understanding people’s needs, while the School of Design Innovation drives creativity through design thinking. The entrepreneurship program focuses on testing and validating ideas, and the engineering department assists in building prototypes. Together, all these departments collaborate to find effective solutions to problems.
The **School of Design Innovation** offers an immersive learning experience with expert-led online and offline lectures, one-on-one mentoring, and teamwork-driven projects. Enriched with field visits, cross-cultural art, and design boot camps, the program prepares students for real-world impact.

For the paradigm shift from Design to Design Innovation, the School uses the Chakku’s 7 concerns for innovation by design wherein the students are trained to learn to understand that the design needs to deliver and user delight is the key.
![1st-C-The-Cause-The-resolve-to-solve-a-problem](https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1st-C-The-Cause-The-resolve-to-solve-a-problem.webp)**1st C The Cause: The resolve to solve a problem**
Every design project is initiated by a need which becomes the ‘Cause’ of the entire journey that follows. This need may be a commercial requirement, a social necessity, or a specific niggling problem with an existing product. The recognition of such a need is a key trigger for the project and it can be identified by any of the stakeholders connected to the product – a product manufacturer or marketer, a user, or a product designer.
![2nd-C-The-Context-Understanding-the-problem-space-and-the-environment](https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2nd-C-The-Context-Understanding-the-problem-space-and-the-environment.webp)**2 nd C The Context: Understanding the problem space and the environment**
To study and understand an existing product or similar products in the market, it is critical that the environment in which the product is used is understood comprehensively. This means that a designer must study the users and their perspectives on the product. Often this involves several rounds of interaction and observation.
![3rd-C-The-Comprehension-Arriving-at-design-insights](https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/3rd-C-The-Comprehension-Arriving-at-design-insights.webp)**3rd C The Comprehension: Arriving at design insights**
At this stage, the designer analyses all the information gathered and methodically lists out their observations and perceptions of any notable issues in the use of the product. Such analysis results in the thorough, all-round comprehension of a product as it functions within the contexts of its use. The design insights thus arrived at give rise to creative ideas and form the basis for the intervention that follows.
![4th-C-The-Check-Creating-a-project-brief](https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4th-C-The-Check-Creating-a-project-brief.webp)**4th C The Check: Creating a project brief**
The check is an essential step in understanding what requirements the product should ultimately meet and what problems the design intervention should address. The check, which is often a document in the form of a product brief, is created from the design insights and must be approved by the client. The product brief is an important point of reference throughout the journey as concepts and prototypes are created and evaluated.
![5th-C-The-Conception-Generating-ideas-and-concept](https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/5th-C-The-Conception-Generating-ideas-and-concept.webp)  
**5th C The Conception: Generating ideas and concept**
Using the product brief, the designer arrives at multiple ideas to come up with solutions for the problems listed. At this crucial stage, ideas are proposed and grouped into clusters. This makes possible the consideration of multiple concepts. Finally, the team zeroes in on one all-encompassing concept that best addresses all aspects of the product.
![6th C The Crafting: Building mock-ups and prototypes](https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/6th-C-The-Crafting-Building-mock-ups-and-prototypes.webp)**6th C The Crafting: Building mock-ups and prototypes**
The final concept is further refined against various criteria like use of material and manufacturing limitations. Depending on the user profile, the designer at this stage creates several style options and zeroes in on the one that addresses the aesthetics concerns in the best manner. The final product design is showcased by creating small scale mock-up models, CAD models or working prototypes. The final product which meets the product brief conditions is then taken up for mass production.­

### **Idea to Impact**
The School of Design Innovation will be mentored by the best design brains from across the world. This pursuit of design excellence is bolstered by a partnership with the Pininfarina Design Academy in Torino, Italy and Shenoy Innovation Studio IDC IITB.
The labs and studios across Mahindra University are well equipped so that students can build their mock-ups and proof of concepts for design innovation. The students are motivated to use the Chakku’s 7 concerns of design thinking, formulated by our founding dean Prof. B.K. Chakravarthy from his 3 decades of design innovation experience. This is used as a project management template and collaborative tool for taking design to market.
**Design Differentiator:**
**_SDI design methodology follows the Innovation by Design paradigm, where design thinking exists in a continuous, reciprocal loop like a Möbius strip- ensuring that the process and the outcomes are seamlessly interconnected and continuously refined._**
Mahindra University promotes teamwork among students from various fields to tackle real-world challenges. The humanities help in understanding people’s needs, while the School of Design Innovation drives creativity through design thinking. The entrepreneurship program focuses on testing and validating ideas, and the engineering department assists in building prototypes. Together, all these departments collaborate to find effective solutions to problems.
The **School of Design Innovation** offers an immersive learning experience with expert-led online and offline lectures, one-on-one mentoring, and teamwork-driven projects. Enriched with field visits, cross-cultural art, and design boot camps, the program prepares students for real-world impact.
### **Concerns for Innovation**
For the paradigm shift from Design to Design Innovation, the School uses the Chakku’s 7 concerns for innovation by design wherein the students are trained to learn to understand that the design needs to deliver and user delight is the key.
![1st-C-The-Cause-The-resolve-to-solve-a-problem](https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/1st-C-The-Cause-The-resolve-to-solve-a-problem.webp)**1 st C The Cause: The resolve to solve a problem**
Every design project is initiated by a need which becomes the ‘Cause’ of the entire journey that follows. This need may be a commercial requirement, a social necessity, or a specific niggling problem with an existing product. The recognition of such a need is a key trigger for the project and it can be identified by any of the stakeholders connected to the product – a product manufacturer or marketer, a user, or a product designer.
![2nd-C-The-Context-Understanding-the-problem-space-and-the-environment](https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2nd-C-The-Context-Understanding-the-problem-space-and-the-environment.webp)**2 nd C The Context: Understanding the problem space and the environment**
To study and understand an existing product or similar products in the market, it is critical that the environment in which the product is used is understood comprehensively. This means that a designer must study the users and their perspectives on the product. Often this involves several rounds of interaction and observation.
![3rd-C-The-Comprehension-Arriving-at-design-insights](https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/3rd-C-The-Comprehension-Arriving-at-design-insights.webp)**3 rd C The Comprehension: Arriving at design insights**
At this stage, the designer analyses all the information gathered and methodically lists out their observations and perceptions of any notable issues in the use of the product. Such analysis results in the thorough, all-round comprehension of a product as it functions within the contexts of its use. The design insights thus arrived at give rise to creative ideas and form the basis for the intervention that follows.
![4th-C-The-Check-Creating-a-project-brief](https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/4th-C-The-Check-Creating-a-project-brief.webp)**4 th C The Check: Creating a project brief**
The check is an essential step in understanding what requirements the product should ultimately meet and what problems the design intervention should address. The check, which is often a document in the form of a product brief, is created from the design insights and must be approved by the client. The product brief is an important point of reference throughout the journey as concepts and prototypes are created and evaluated.
![5th-C-The-Conception-Generating-ideas-and-concept](https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/5th-C-The-Conception-Generating-ideas-and-concept.webp)**5 th C The Conception: Generating ideas and concept**
Using the product brief, the designer arrives at multiple ideas to come up with solutions for the problems listed. At this crucial stage, ideas are proposed and grouped into clusters. This makes possible the consideration of multiple concepts. Finally, the team zeroes in on one all-encompassing concept that best addresses all aspects of the product.
![6th C The Crafting: Building mock-ups and prototypes](https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/6th-C-The-Crafting-Building-mock-ups-and-prototypes.webp)**6 th C The Crafting: Building mock-ups and prototypes**
The final concept is further refined against various criteria like use of material and manufacturing limitations. Depending on the user profile, the designer at this stage creates several style options and zeroes in on the one that addresses the aesthetics concerns in the best manner. The final product design is showcased by creating small scale mock-up models, CAD models or working prototypes. The final product which meets the product brief conditions is then taken up for mass production.­
![7th-C-The-Connection-Delighting-the-user](https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/7th-C-The-Connection-Delighting-the-user.webp)**7 th C The Connection: Delighting the user**
The last but critically important concern is the connection the new product makes with the user. This connection or the bond between the user and the product is formed only when the user is satisfied with the product’s performance and begins to cherish it, which in turn creates an increased demand for the product. In fact, it is the customer’s satisfaction that makes a winning product and functions as the most important criterion for innovation.

#### **Methodology**
As AI transforms education, this study explores its role in helping first-year design students learn the “Elements and Principles of Design.” Conducted with 31 students at School of Design Innovation in Hyderabad, India, the research aimed to understand how AI, combined with traditional teaching, can shape skill development.
#### **Pebble Exercise & Evaluation**
Design students created dot-based artwork on palm-sized pebbles using various paints and tools, exploring color, medium, and composition in a half-day activity. Each student completed two versions-before and after receiving AI feedback. These artworks were anonymized and evaluated by three independent experts and an AI system on six parameters: theme expression, color interplay, precision, creativity, composition, and overall design.
This dual evaluation aimed to assess the impact of AI guidance on student performance, blending human insight with AI’s objective analysis.
